# Earthquake_prediction_using_ML
The codes showcase an application of hybrid neural networks, support vector machine, and particle swarm optimization for creating an earthquake prediction model. The model uses mathematically computed seismic features based on past earthquakes. The work has been mainly done from 2016 to 2019, leading to the publication of several research articles. The codes have been written in MATLAB. A detailed explanation of the whole concept, seismic parameters computation and the applied machine learning technique is provided here: [https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0199004].


## Modules
The repository contains two main modules:
* [Mathematically computed seismic parameters]
* [Machine learning for earthquake forecasting]

## Mathematically computed seismic parameters
Seismic parameters are computed from raw seismicity using mathematical concepts discussed in the literature.
